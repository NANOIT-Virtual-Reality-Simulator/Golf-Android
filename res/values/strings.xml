    <string name="about">Golf (also known as Polish Polka, Polish Poker, Turtle, Hara Kiri, or Crazy Nines) is a card game where players try to earn the lowest number of points (similar to the sport, Golf) over the course of nine deals (or holes to further use golfing terminology).
		\n\n
		HOW TO PLAY:\n
		The objective of Golf is to obtain the lowest possible score.\n
		A turn is signified by a card flip or a card swap.\n
		A player may flip one of the eight cards on the left portion of the screen or swap a card with any other card on the board (including the deck and discard piles).\n
		Once a player makes the flip or swap, the next player goes.\n
		\n
		The game is over when one player flips all of his/her cards over.\n\n
		
		SCORING:\n
		The game is scored as follows:\n
		Ace: 0 points\n
		2: 2 points\n
		3: 3 points\n
		4: 4 points\n
		5: 5 points\n
		6: 6 points\n
		7: 7 points\n
		8: 8 points\n
		9: 9 points\n
		10: 10 points\n
		Jack: 10 points\n
		Queen: 10 points\n
		King: -3 points\n
		\n
		When a card is placed directly above or below another card of the same value, the values of both cards cancel out to form a value of 0.\n
		
		
		\n\n\n\n
		This version of Golf was created by Dillon Gresham, Connor Hoene, Shayan Motovalli, and Austin Moore in the Spring of 
		2014. " </string>
